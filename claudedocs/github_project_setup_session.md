# GitHub Project Setup Session - SuperMarket Receipt Manager

## Session Summary
**Date**: 2025-01-14
**Duration**: ~30 minutes
**Status**: GitHub repository structure partially complete
**Repository**: `caiogranero/supermarket-receipt-manager`

## üéØ What Was Accomplished

### ‚úÖ Successfully Created
1. **Repository Documentation**
   - Complete README.md with project overview
   - Technical architecture documentation
   - Development phases outlined

2. **Issue Templates**
   - Feature request template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature-request.md`)
   - Bug report template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.md`)

3. **Core Issues Created** (Issues #1-14)
   - **Milestone Tracking Issues**: #1-6 (one per phase)
   - **Foundation Issues**: #7-9, 11 (API setup, DB, Auth, React PWA)
   - **NFCe Processing**: #10, 12 (Research, Web scraping)
   - **Smart Features**: #13 (Shopping list algorithm)
   - **Deployment**: #14 (Render.com pipeline)

### ‚ùå **CRITICAL GAP IDENTIFIED**
**Missing GitHub Infrastructure**:
- ‚ùå No actual GitHub **Milestones** created (only tracking issues)
- ‚ùå No **Project Board** with kanban columns
- ‚ùå No **Labels** system setup
- ‚ùå Issues not properly linked to milestones
- ‚ùå Only ~50% of planned 28 issues created

## üö® What Still Needs To Be Done

### Immediate Next Steps (High Priority)
1. **Create Actual GitHub Milestones**
   - Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Due: Week 1)
   - Phase 2: NFCe Processing Engine (Due: Week 2)
   - Phase 3: Core Data Management (Due: Week 2-3)
   - Phase 4: Smart Features (Due: Week 3-4)
   - Phase 5: User Interface (Due: Week 3-4)
   - Phase 6: Production Deployment (Due: Week 4-5)

2. **Setup Labels System**
   ```
   Technical Areas: backend, frontend, database, deployment, testing
   Work Types: feature, bug, enhancement, documentation, research
   Priorities: priority-high, priority-medium, priority-low
   Sizes: size-xs, size-s, size-m, size-l, size-xl
   Phases: phase-1, phase-2, phase-3, phase-4, phase-5, phase-6
   ```

3. **Create Project Board**
   - Columns: Backlog ‚Üí Ready ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Done
   - Views: Main Board, Current Milestone, Backend Focus, Frontend Focus

4. **Complete Missing Issues** (15 more needed)
   - Remaining Phase 1 issues (development environment setup)
   - All Phase 2-3 issues (data management, CRUD operations)
   - All Phase 5 issues (UI components)
   - Remaining deployment and testing issues

### Technical Note
**API Limitation Discovered**: The GitHub API integration appears to have authentication or permission limitations that prevented creating actual milestones and project boards programmatically. This will need to be done manually through the GitHub web interface.

## üìã Current Repository State

### Repository URL
https://github.com/caiogranero/supermarket-receipt-manager

### Files Created
- `README.md` - Complete project documentation
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature-request.md`
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.md`

### Issues Created (14 total)
- **Milestones**: #1-6 (tracking issues, not actual milestones)
- **Development**: #7-14 (core implementation tasks)

## üéØ Project Context Preserved

### Core Requirements (From Previous Sessions)
- **Purpose**: Personal inventory tracking via NFCe QR code scanning
- **Users**: 2 users (personal use - user + wife)
- **Tech Stack**: C# ASP.NET Core, React PWA, PostgreSQL, Render.com
- **Primary Goal**: Never forget what to buy at supermarket
- **Usage**: ~3 receipts per week, weekly shopping pattern

### Development Strategy
- 6-phase implementation over 4-6 weeks
- Mobile-first PWA design for grocery shopping
- Free hosting on Render.com with cold start tolerance
- Simple authentication, focus on core inventory value

## üîÑ Recovery Instructions for Next Session

### To Complete GitHub Setup:
1. **Manually create milestones** in GitHub web interface
2. **Setup labels system** through GitHub settings
3. **Create project board** with kanban workflow
4. **Link existing issues** to proper milestones and labels
5. **Create remaining 15 issues** following established patterns

### To Begin Development:
Once GitHub structure is complete, start with:
- Issue #7: Setup C# ASP.NET Core API Project Structure
- Issue #11: Create React PWA Scaffolding (parallel track)
- Issue #10: Research NFCe URL Structure (informs scraping strategy)

## üí° Session Insights

### What Worked Well
- Clear project structure and documentation
- Well-defined issues with acceptance criteria
- Good separation of concerns across phases
- Realistic timeline and scope for personal project

### Lessons Learned
- GitHub API has limitations for creating repository infrastructure
- Manual setup required for milestones and project boards
- Issue templates are crucial for maintaining quality
- Repository documentation serves as single source of truth

### Next Session Focus
1. Complete GitHub project infrastructure manually
2. Begin actual development with Issue #7 (C# API setup)
3. Establish development workflow and patterns

---
*Session Status: GitHub structure 60% complete, ready for manual completion and development start*
*Next Action: Complete milestones/labels/project board manually, then begin development*
