## Description
Set up the complete deployment pipeline for the SuperMarket Receipt Manager on Vercel, leveraging their seamless Next.js integration and serverless architecture.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Next.js application deployed to Vercel with auto-deployment
- [ ] Vercel PostgreSQL database configured and connected
- [ ] Environment variables configured securely
- [ ] Custom domain configured (if desired)
- [ ] HTTPS/SSL certificates working automatically
- [ ] GitHub integration with automatic deployments
- [ ] Edge functions optimized and functional

## Vercel Free Tier Benefits
**Generous Limits**:
- **Function Executions**: 100GB-hrs/month
- **Bandwidth**: 100GB/month
- **Database**: 512MB PostgreSQL (Neon)
- **Edge Requests**: Unlimited
- **No Cold Starts**: Edge network optimization

**Perfect for Your Scale**:
- 2 users × 5 receipts/week = well within limits
- Serverless scaling means $0 cost
- Global edge network for fast loading
- Built-in PostgreSQL database

## Deployment Architecture
```
Next.js App (Vercel)
├── Frontend (Static Site Generation)
├── API Routes (Serverless Functions)
└── Vercel PostgreSQL (Neon Database)
```

## Configuration Requirements

### Vercel Project Setup
- **Framework**: Next.js (automatically detected)
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (automatic)
- **Node Version**: 18+ LTS (automatic)
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `POSTGRES_URL` (Vercel PostgreSQL connection)
  - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (securely generated)
  - `NEXTAUTH_URL` (production domain)

### Database Configuration
- **Provider**: Vercel PostgreSQL (Neon integration)
- **Setup**: One-click database creation
- **Migration**: Prisma migrate deploy
- **Connection**: Automatic connection pooling

## Environment Variables Security
- Secrets managed securely in Vercel dashboard
- Automatic environment variable injection
- No sensitive data in repository
- Proper separation between preview and production

## Monitoring and Analytics
- Built-in Vercel Analytics (Real User Monitoring)
- Function logs in Vercel dashboard
- Performance monitoring with Web Vitals
- Error tracking with automatic alerting

## Domain and SSL
- Custom domain configuration (optional)
- Automatic HTTPS/SSL with edge certificates
- Global CDN with edge caching
- Security headers automatically configured

## Deployment Workflow
1. **GitHub Integration**: Connect repository to Vercel
2. **Auto-Deploy**: Every push to main triggers deployment
3. **Preview Deployments**: PR branches get preview URLs
4. **Database Migration**: Prisma migrations run on deploy
5. **Edge Distribution**: App distributed globally
6. **Health Check**: Built-in function monitoring

## Zero Cold Start Architecture
Vercel's edge network eliminates traditional cold starts:
- Static pages served instantly from CDN
- API routes optimized for fast execution
- Global edge network reduces latency
- No sleep/wake cycles like traditional hosting

## Validation
- [ ] Next.js application accessible at production URL
- [ ] PWA features working (installable, offline capable)
- [ ] Database connection working with Vercel PostgreSQL
- [ ] End-to-end workflow functional (QR scan → data processing → display)
- [ ] SSL certificates working automatically
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] Serverless functions executing within time limits
- [ ] GitHub auto-deployment working

## Dependencies
- All development complete (Issues #7-#13)
- Next.js application with PWA features (Issue #11)
- Database models and API routes (Issues #8-#9)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Complete Next.js application deployed on Vercel
- [ ] Both users can access and use the system
- [ ] Production environment stable with monitoring
- [ ] Auto-deployment pipeline functional
- [ ] Zero-cost hosting achieved within free tier limits
- [ ] Ready for user acceptance testing and production use
