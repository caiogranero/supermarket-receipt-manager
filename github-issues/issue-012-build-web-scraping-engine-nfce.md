## Description
Implement the core web scraping engine to extract purchase data from São Paulo NFCe (Nota Fiscal de Consumidor Eletrônica) system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Successfully scrape receipt data from NFCe system
- [ ] Extract items with names, prices, quantities from receipt pages
- [ ] Handle site downtime gracefully with appropriate error messages
- [ ] Implement retry logic for failed requests with exponential backoff
- [ ] Parse different receipt formats from various supermarket chains
- [ ] Handle special characters and encoding correctly
- [ ] Validate extracted data for completeness and accuracy

## Technical Requirements
- **Browser Automation**: Puppeteer for headless Chrome automation
- **Serverless Optimization**: Optimized for Vercel's serverless functions
- **Timeout Management**: Complete scraping within 15s function limit
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for network and parsing issues
- **Data Validation**: Validate extracted data against expected formats
- **Performance**: Handle requests efficiently for ~5 receipts per week

## Implementation Strategy
Based on research findings from Issue #10, implement the recommended scraping approach:
- Use Puppeteer for headless browser automation
- Implement proper headers and user agent strings
- Handle JavaScript-rendered content efficiently
- Execute within Vercel's 15s serverless function timeout
- Use efficient scraping patterns to minimize execution time

## Sample Data Structure
```typescript
interface ScrapedReceiptData {
  receiptId: string;
  date: Date;
  storeName: string;
  storeAddress: string;
  total: number;
  items: ScrapedItem[];
}

interface ScrapedItem {
  name: string;
  quantity: number;
  unitPrice: number;
  totalPrice: number;
}
```

## Error Scenarios to Handle
- NFCe site is down or unreachable
- Invalid or malformed URLs
- Receipts with missing or corrupted data
- Network timeouts and connection issues
- Rate limiting from the NFCe system
- Changes in HTML structure (graceful degradation)

## Validation
- [ ] Successfully scrapes the provided sample URL
- [ ] Extracts all items with correct prices and quantities
- [ ] Handles network errors gracefully
- [ ] Processes receipts from different supermarket chains
- [ ] Performance acceptable for personal use (3 receipts/week)
- [ ] Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Dependencies
- Issue #10: NFCe URL structure research must be complete
- Issue #8: Prisma database models for storing scraped data

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Node.js web scraping engine functional and tested
- [ ] Puppeteer integration working within Vercel limits
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive and user-friendly
- [ ] Data extraction reliable across different receipt formats
- [ ] Ready for integration with Next.js API routes
- [ ] Performance optimized for serverless execution
