## Description
Research and document the NFCe (Nota Fiscal de Consumidor Eletrônica) URL structure from São Paulo to design an effective scraping strategy for extracting receipt data.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] NFCe URL format fully documented and understood
- [ ] QR code parameter structure analyzed and decoded
- [ ] Scraping approach defined (HTTP requests vs headless browser)
- [ ] Sample URLs tested and data extraction confirmed
- [ ] Technical constraints and limitations identified
- [ ] Error scenarios documented (site down, invalid URL, etc.)
- [ ] Scraping frequency and rate limiting considerations analyzed

## Research Areas

### URL Structure Analysis
Sample URL to analyze:
```
https://www.nfce.fazenda.sp.gov.br/NFCeConsultaPublica/Paginas/ConsultaQRCode.aspx?p=35250956527062001697651030000227311007031750|2|1|1|34adcd24f24be99d3b4440f2ab1e6abb0ecbf71f
```

**Research Questions:**
- What does each part of the parameter string represent?
- How are receipt ID, verification codes, and other data encoded?
- Are there different URL formats for different scenarios?

### Web Scraping Strategy
- **HTTP Analysis**: Can data be extracted with simple HTTP requests?
- **JavaScript Requirements**: Does the page require JavaScript execution?
- **Browser Requirements**: Is headless Chrome/Playwright needed?
- **Response Format**: HTML parsing vs JSON API responses?

### Technical Constraints
- **Rate Limiting**: How many requests per minute are allowed?
- **User Agent Requirements**: Are specific headers required?
- **Session Management**: Are cookies or sessions needed?
- **Error Handling**: How does the site respond to invalid requests?

## Deliverables
- [ ] Technical documentation of NFCe URL format
- [ ] Scraping strategy recommendation with justification
- [ ] Code examples for URL parsing and validation
- [ ] Test results from sample URLs
- [ ] Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

## Validation
- [ ] Successfully parse and validate sample URLs
- [ ] Extract receipt data from test URLs
- [ ] Document all findings clearly
- [ ] Provide recommendations for implementation

## Dependencies
- None (research task)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Complete technical analysis documented
- [ ] Scraping approach clearly defined and justified
- [ ] Sample code demonstrates feasibility
- [ ] Ready to guide implementation of URL parser and scraper
